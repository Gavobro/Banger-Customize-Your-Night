# What does it do?
This application allows a user to select a “meal item” and movie genre, that they feel like eating and watching. The application will connect to two different APIs and give the user a random meal and movie for their enjoyment based on their selection.

# User story:
- As a user of “Bangé”, I do not know what to make for a meal.
- When I am presented with a website that could help, I would like the option for a button to randomize meal ideas and present me with possible foods.
- As a user, I would like to choose the type of meals that can be generated by the website.
- A drop down menu asking what I’m in the mood for would be expected.
- When a meal is generated, as a user, I would like to see a recipe on how to make that meal.
- As a user I would like to be recommended a movie.
- A drop down menu asking what I’m in the mood for would be expected.
- As a user i would like for the APIs to display an image of the meal and of the movies that were generated for me on a page I can scroll up and down on.


# What did we do?
- Created 3 .html files. One being a homepage, one being the app, and the last being a team summary.
- Created working buttons which lets us change what page we are viewing.
- Added a food API that displays an image of the product selected along with its recipe.
- Added a movie API which displays a randomized list of films based on what the user has selected.
- Created a .js that pulls information out of the APIs on our page and displays them in collumns.
- Created a .css file that styles all of the .html pages.
- Designed a unique logo for the page.
